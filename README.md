This project illustrates a fundamental application of Hardhat. It includes a prototype smart contract, a test suite for that contract, and a script to deploy the contract.

Feel free to execute any of the following actions:

```shell
npx hardhat help
npx hardhat test
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
npx hardhat run scripts/function.js
```

You can run these commands to explore and interact with the project.
